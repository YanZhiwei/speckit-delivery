# Spec Kit Delivery

Use the installed `speckit.delivery.route` command with the user's request.
In Codex Skills mode, that installed command is a skill named
`speckit-delivery-route` under an active skills root (for example
`$CODEX_HOME/skills/speckit-delivery-route/SKILL.md` or
`.agents/skills/speckit-delivery-route/SKILL.md`). Read and execute that skill
instead of checking for a `speckit*` executable on PATH. The extension command
is the canonical cross-integration owner of lane routing, ADR lifecycle, Ralph
orchestration, and completion conditions.

The native skill is a convenience surface only. Preserve the selected project's
existing workflow and report a missing Delivery extension as an installation
blocker only when neither the rendered extension command nor the matching
Codex skill entry is available. Do not publish, push, merge, or create external
resources unless the user separately authorized that action.
